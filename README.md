# Peter Shirley Ray Tracing

My C++ source code for Ray Tracing book series by Peter Shirley.



The image format used in these books is `.ppm`. If you prefer other formats, I put `stb` library in this repository as a submodule under `./include/stb`. In `main.cpp` under the directory of each chapter of these books, I also provide the code to produce `.png` image as comments. You can switch to it by commenting the `for .ppm` part and uncommenting the `for .png` part.
