# Peter Shirley Ray Tracing

My C++ source code for [ray tracing book series](https://raytracing.github.io/) by Peter Shirley.



The image format used in these books is `.ppm`. If you prefer other formats, I put [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb) libraries in this repository as a submodule under `include/stb`.

In each `main.cpp` file, I provide both the code to produce `.ppm` image and the code to produce `.png` image, wrapped by macro `PPM` and `PNG` respectively. You can enable/disable each type of output by define/remove its corresponding macro at the beginning of the file.
